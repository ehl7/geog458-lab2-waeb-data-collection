## Topic and Search Terms

Two major conflicts happening in the world right now are the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas war. In both cases the U.S. is allied with one of the belligerents, those being Ukraine and Israel respectively. These conflicts have sparked recent debates within the U.S. political sphere regarding ideas about which countries the U.S. should support and whether the U.S. should be sending aid to countries involved in wars at all. 

For this assignment I wanted to compare how the topic of the U.S. sending aid to these two countries has been covered by the media on YouTube. The circumstances of these two conflicts are quite different with Ukraine being invaded by a major power whereas Israel is engaging a relatively small military organization. There are also the complications and history surrounding Israel and Palestine to take into consideration, and Israel has faced widespread criticism regarding its treatment of Palestinian civilians both throughout this conflict as well as historically. My perception surrounding the discourse regarding sending aid to Israel and Ukraine is that among the government and lawmakers there seems to be a lot of uncritical support for Israel, however among the general population I think support is a lot more split. For Ukraine, it seems that the government and military are strongly in support of aiding Ukraine. Among lawmakers and the general population I think support for Ukraine is fairly high as well but there does seem to be a sizable minority in favor of cutting aid to Ukraine. My goal for this assignment was to see whether these perceptions were supported by and/or reflected in media coverage of the topic. I performed two searches using three key phrases each. For the search regarding Israel I used "US aid Israel", "US sends aid to Israel", "United States aid Israel", and for the Ukraine search I used "US aid Ukraine", "US sends aid to Ukraine", "United States aid Ukraine".


## Word Clouds

## Comparison

Overall the two word clouds are quite similar. Both of course prominently feature the name of the respective country, as well as the forces they're engaged with, Russia, and Hamas, the word "aid" as well as various words relating to President Joe Biden. "Military" is large in both however it's larger in the Israel word cloud. Both feature the words Billion and million, though million is much less prominent in Israel's. Both contain words referring to congress, with Israel's relatively prominently featuring "senate" and "republican" and Ukraine's featuring "senate", "congress" and "republican". One prominent word in Israel's word cloud not present in Ukraine's is "support". Another difference is that Israel's seems to feature more mentions of specific types of weaponry such as "warships", "jets", "carrier", "missile", and "arms", whereas Ukraine's only refers to "drones". Finally, while relatively small, a word I noticed in Israel's not present in Ukraine's is the word "Evil".

Overall I think that the observed patterns in the word clouds are fairly predictable. It makes sense that they would contain words referring to the amount or value of aid as well as references to congress as it is the lawmakers who determine the amount and type of aid provided I believe. As for why the word "Republican" is more prominent in both word clouds compared to "Democrat", it is my impression that Republicans have been more vocal in their support of Israel and in not supporting sending aid to Ukraine. Why Israel includes more references to types of weaponry could be because the U.S. is able to be more involved in the conflict, sending Navy ships to the area etc. whereas the U.S. could risk provoking Russia if they were to get too involved in Ukraine. Also Gaza, where Israel is attacking, is a very small area meaning it has been quite clear and visible how different weaponry is being used. Finally, while most people seem to agree that what Russia is doing in Ukraine is wrong, the conflict between Israel and Hamas seems to have prompted a lot of conversations regarding the ethics of the historical and continuing treatment of Palestinians, as well as Israel's response to the attacks on October 7th.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I found the word clouds to be fairly predictable, I don't think they revealed anything especially noteworthy unfortunately. Before completing the assignment I did expect the word clouds to more clearly reflect public opinion on the topic of sending aid to the two countries, but the word clouds ended up appearing to mostly represent facts about the topic without really enough clearly opinionated words to draw a solid conclusion on public sentiment. I think this could be in part due to the videos returned by the searches heavily featuring news outlets. To improve this research in the future it could be beneficial to retrieve data from other social media platforms, such as Twitter, where individuals might be more likely to share their opinions. Using different key words and phrases could also improve results, particularly, it's possible that using more charged or biased terms might return results which more clearly reflect public opinion.
